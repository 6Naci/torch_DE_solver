TEDEouS - Torch Exhaustive Differential Equation Solver
=============================



The purpose of the project
--------------------------

1. Make equation discovery more transparent and illustrative
2. Combine power of pytorch, numerical methods and math overall to conquer and solve ALL {O,P}DEs. There are some examples to provide a little insight to an operator form
